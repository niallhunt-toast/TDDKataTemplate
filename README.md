# TDD Kata

Brought to you by Niall Hunt and Roberto Gambuzzi

This TDD based Kata is designed to help you understand the principles of TDD and how to write test files.
This is a group exercise and you are encouraged to work together to complete the tasks. 

To get started clone this repo. You will find the instructions for each step in the relevant assets file.

The Kata itself is a slightly modified version of Gianfranco Alongi's [grocery store kata](https://github.com/Gianfrancoalongi/incremental_katas/tree/master/Grocery_store). 

## Languages

This repo consists of the boilerplate and setup for 3 languages:

* Kotlin
* Python
* Typescript

There are 3 folders with the relevant scaffolding. Clone this repo and go to the appropriate branch for the language you are using.
