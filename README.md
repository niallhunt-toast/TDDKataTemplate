# BDD Kata

Brought to you by Niall Hunt and Roberto Gambuzzi

This BDD based Kata is designed to help you understand the principles of BDD and how to write scenarios and feature files. This is a group exercise and you are encouraged to work together to complete the tasks. 

To get started clone this repo and checkout the appropriate branch for the language you are using. You will find the instructions for each step in the relevant feature file. You will find the instructions for running the tests in the README for each language.

The Kata itself is a slightly modified version of Gianfranco Alongi's [grocery store kata](https://github.com/Gianfrancoalongi/incremental_katas/tree/master/Grocery_store). 

## Languages

This repo consists of the boilerplate and setup for 3 languages:

* Kotlin
* Python
* Typescript

There are 3 branches with the relevant scaffolding. Clone this repo and checkout the appropriate branch for the language you are using.

## Step 1

Step one provides you with the `feature` file and step definitions. You are asked to complete the code to make the tests pass.

## Step 2

Step 2 asks you to work together to create the `feature` file with the appropriate scenarios. You will then write step definitions and the relevant code to make the tests pass.

## Step 3

In Step 3 you are given an incomplete `feature` file and are expected to work together to come up with additional scenarios. You will then write the step definitions and the relevant code to make the tests pass.
